Euclidean Distance Formual:

    if p = (p1, p2,....pn) and q = (q1, q2 ..... qn)

    Distance(p,q) = (q,p) = SQUARE_ROOT(Sum of i to n (qi - pi)square)




DrawBack's of Euclidean Distance:

    1) It will creates clusters on Uniform data which is incorrect. It dosent tell you when the data
       just does not cluster and take your research to dead end.

    2) Scaling issues due to euclidian distance.


Examples of where unsupervised learning methods might be useful:

    1) An advertising platform segments the U.S. population into smaller groups with similar
       demographics and purchasing habits so that advertisers can reach their target market with
       relevant ads.
    2) Airbnb groups its housing listings into neighborhoods so that users can navigate listings
       more easily.
    3) A data science team reduces the number of dimensions in a large data set to simplify
       modeling and reduce file size.
