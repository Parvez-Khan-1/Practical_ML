Principle Component Analysis (PCA):


- Principle Component Anaysis is a technique of feature extraction. It combines our input variables in specific way,
  then we can drop "least important" variables while still retainin the most valuable parts of all of the variables.


When should I use PCA?
    - Do you want to reduce the number of variables, but aren’t able to identify variables to completely remove from consideration?
    - Do you want to ensure your variables are independent of one another?
    - Are you comfortable making your independent variables less interpretable?
If you answered “yes” to all three questions, then PCA is a good method to use.
If you answered “no” to question 3, you should not use PCA.



An important machine learning method for dimensionality reduction is called Principal Component Analysis.
